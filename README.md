# D3 Homework - Data Journalism and D3

## Background

Welcome to the newsroom! You've just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper. You're tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks, Age, and Income

HW (Required) – See files index_1.html, app_1.js

The graph shows a direct correlation between percentage of the population in poverty and the percentage of the population that lacks healthcare.  If a straight line were fitted to the data, the slope would be positive left to right.  As percentage of the population in poverty increases so does the lack of healthcare.

In Poverty (%) vs Lacks Healthcare (%) - The graph shows a direct correlation between percentage of the population in poverty and the percentage of the population that lacks healthcare.  If a straight line were fitted to the data, the slope would be positive left to right.  As percentage of the population in poverty increases so does the lack of healthcare.

In Poverty (%) vs Smokes (%) - The graph shows a direct correlation between percentage of the population in poverty and the percentage of the population that smokes.  If a straight line were fitted to the data, the slope would be positive left to right.  It is surprising that as poverty increase so does the percentage of the population who smokes.

In Poverty (%) vs Obesity (%) - The graph shows a direct correlation between percentage of the population in poverty and the percentage of the population that is obese.  If a straight line were fitted to the data, the slope would be positive left to right.  Although the slope would be closer to one which to me is surprising. 

Age (Median) vs Lacks Healthcare (%) - The graph shows a direct correlation between median age of the population and the percentage of the population that lacks healthcare.  If a straight line were fitted to the data, the slope would be negative left to right.  Perhaps this due to older populations having access to free medical care.

Age (Median) vs Smokes (%) - The graph shows a direct correlation between median age of the population and the percentage of the population that smokes.  If a straight line were fitted to the data, the slope would be positive left to right.  I think we are past the days when older generations were not aware of the hazards of smoking so I guess in the end we don’t necessarily get wiser with age.

Age (Median) vs Obesity (%) - The graph shows a no distinct correlation between median age of the population and the percentage of the population that is obese.  If a straight line were fitted to the data, the slope would be approximately one.  I think Americans in general are prone to obesity due to our sedentary lifestyles.

Household Income (Median) vs Lacks Healthcare (%) - The graph shows a direct correlation between median household income of the population and the percentage of the population that lacks healthcare.  If a straight line were fitted to the data, the slope would be negative left to right.  Seems logical that folks with more income are more likely to have healthcare.

Household Income (Median) vs Smokes (%) - The graph shows a direct correlation between median household income of the population and the percentage of the population that smokes.  If a straight line were fitted to the data, the slope would be negative left to right.  Seems somewhat illogical because smoking is in general an expensive habit.

Household Income (Median) vs Obesity (%) - The graph shows a direct correlation between median household income of the population and the percentage of the population that is obese.  If a straight line were fitted to the data, the slope would be negative left to right. Unhealthy foods are certainly less expensive than healthier dining options.

Note: I was not able to get the state abbreviations to display correctly in concert with the tool tip function.  So I commented out the code for the state abbreviations because the tool tips are way cooler.
